Guardian Haiku
==============

Eventually this will extract haiku from the guardian website, it's a work in progress.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SimonStJG/GuardianHaiku.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SimonStJG/GuardianHaiku)

It's also an experiment (for me) in:

* Pythons new [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module.
* Avoiding classes, replacing them with contexts and generators.  (Making an exception for exceptions, though).
* Avoiding state.

It's a brave new world.
